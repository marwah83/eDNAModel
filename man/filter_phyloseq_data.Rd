\title{Filter and Clean a Phyloseq Object}
\usage{
filter_phyloseq_data(
  phyloseq_obj,
  min_species_sum = 30,
  save_path = "phyloseq_filtered.RDS"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{phyloseq_obj}{A `phyloseq` object to be filtered.}

\item{min_species_sum}{Minimum total abundance required for a species to be retained. Default is 30.}

\item{save_path}{Optional path to save the filtered `phyloseq` object as an `.RDS` file. Default is `"phyloseq_filtered.RDS"`. Use `NULL` to skip saving.}
}
\value{
A filtered `phyloseq` object with rare species and empty samples removed.
}
\description{
This function filters a `phyloseq` object by removing:
- species (taxa) with all-zero counts,
- samples with all-zero counts,
- species whose total counts are below a specified threshold.
The resulting filtered object is optionally saved as an `.RDS` file.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
  \item Removes OTUs (species) with zero total counts across all samples.
  \item Removes samples with zero total counts across all OTUs.
  \item Removes rare species whose total abundance is below `min_species_sum`.
  \item Prunes the original `phyloseq` object accordingly.
  \item Optionally saves the cleaned object.
}

Messages are printed to summarize what was filtered and whether the output was saved.

\dontrun{
library(phyloseq)
data(GlobalPatterns)
filtered <- filter_phyloseq_data(GlobalPatterns, min_species_sum = 50)
