\title{Compute Residuals from eDNAModel Fit}
\usage{
compute_residuals_TMB(model, y, X, type = c("pearson", "response", "deviance"))
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An object of class `eDNAModel` returned by `run_full_TMB()`.}

\item{y}{A numeric matrix of observed counts (replicates Ã— species). Must match rownames in X.}

\item{X}{A data.frame of covariates corresponding to rows in `y`. Must include `Site` as a factor.}

\item{type}{Type of residuals: "pearson" (default), "response", or "deviance".}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\describe{
  \item{occupancy_residuals}{A matrix of residuals for the occupancy component.}
  \item{abundance_residuals}{A matrix of residuals for the abundance component.}
}
}
\description{
Computes residuals for both abundance and occupancy components of a hierarchical multispecies model fit using TMB.
}
\examples{
residuals <- compute_residuals_TMB(model = model, y = y, X = X, type = "pearson")
}
