\title{Build model formula with species interaction (e.g., i)}
\usage{
build_formula_with_species_interaction(rhs, response = "y", species_var = "i")
}
\arguments{
\item{rhs}{A quoted right-hand side of the formula, e.g., quote((1 | Site) + treatment + offset(...))}

\item{response}{The response variable (default: "y" for Poisson, "z_sim" for Binomial)}

\item{species_var}{The species variable (default: "i")}
}
\value{
A full formula object: e.g., y ~ (1 | Site) * i + treatment * i + offset(log_reads)
}
